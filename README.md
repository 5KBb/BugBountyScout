# BugBountyScout

BugBountyScout is an automated security testing tool designed for ethical security researchers and bug bounty hunters. The tool helps detect common web application vulnerabilities such as XSS, SQL Injection, insecure headers, and SSL/TLS misconfigurations.

## Features

- **Header Analysis**: Scans for missing or misconfigured security headers
- **SSL/TLS Testing**: Checks for SSL certificate issues and weak cipher suites
- **XSS Detection**: Tests for reflected and DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities
- **SQL Injection Scanning**: Identifies potential SQL injection points
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates comprehensive JSON reports with findings and recommendations
- **Easy-to-use CLI**: Simple command-line interface with customizable options

BugBountyScout - An automated tool for security researchers and bug bounty hunters

positional arguments:
  target                Target URL or domain to scan

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Output directory for reports (default: ./reports)
  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS
                        Number of threads to use (default: 5)
  -v, --verbose         Enable verbose output (default: False)
```

### Examples

Scan a website with verbose output:
```bash
python bugbountyscout.py example.com -v
```

Specify an output directory for reports:
```bash
python bugbountyscout.py example.com -o /path/to/reports
```

Use more threads for faster scanning:
```bash
python bugbountyscout.py example.com -t 10
```

## Understanding Results

After a scan completes, BugBountyScout will:

1. Display a summary table showing the number of findings by severity level
2. Generate a detailed JSON report in the specified output directory

The JSON report contains:
- Scan metadata (target, timestamp, duration)
- Summary statistics
- Detailed findings including:
  - Title
  - Severity
  - Description
  - Recommendation
  - Evidence
